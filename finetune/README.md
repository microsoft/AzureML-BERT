# Finetune natural language processing models using Azure Machine Learning service

This part of the repo contains a walkthrough of using [Azure Machine Learning Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/) to finetune [BERT model](https://github.com/google-research/bert). See more details in this blogpost: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/fine-tune-natural-language-processing-models-using-azure-machine-learning-service/

We provide two set of notebooks: one for PyTorch, and another one for TensorFlow. Please follow the notebooks below for more information:

## **Using the Azure Machine Learning Service**

We are going to demonstrate different experiments on different datasets. In addition to tuning different hyperparameters for various use cases, Azure Machine Learning service can be used to manage the entire lifecycle of the experiments. Azure Machine Learning service provides an end-to-end cloud-based machine learning environment, so customers can develop, train, test, deploy, manage, and track machine learning models, as shown below. It also has full support for open-source technologies, such as PyTorch and TensorFlow which we will be using later.

## **What is in the notebook**

### **Defining the right model for specific task**

To fine-tune the BERT model, the first step is to define the right input and output layer. In the GLUE example, it is defined as a classification task, and the code snippet shows how to create a language classification model using BERT pre-trained models:
```
model = modeling.BertModel(
     config=bert_config,
     is_training=is_training,
     input_ids=input_ids,
     input_mask=input_mask,
     token_type_ids=segment_ids,
     use_one_hot_embeddings=use_one_hot_embeddings)

logits = tf.matmul(output_layer, output_weights, transpose_b=True)
logits = tf.nn.bias_add(logits, output_bias)
probabilities = tf.nn.softmax(logits, axis=-1)
log_probs = tf.nn.log_softmax(logits, axis=-1)
one_hot_labels = tf.one_hot(labels, depth=num_labels, dtype=tf.float32)
per_example_loss = -tf.reduce_sum(one_hot_labels * log_probs, axis=-1)
loss = tf.reduce_mean(per_example_loss)

```

### **Set up training environment using Azure Machine Learning service**

Depending on the size of the dataset, training the model on the actual dataset might be time-consuming. Azure Machine Learning Compute provides access to GPUs either for a single node or multiple nodes to accelerate the training process. Creating a cluster with one or multiple nodes on Azure Machine Learning Compute is very intuitive, as below:

```
compute_config = AmlCompute.provisioning_configuration(vm_size='STANDARD_NC24s_v3',
                                                         min_nodes=0,
                                                         max_nodes=8)
# create the cluster
gpu_compute_target = ComputeTarget.create(ws, gpu_cluster_name, compute_config)
gpu_compute_target.wait_for_completion(show_output=True)
estimator = PyTorch(source_directory=project_folder,
                 compute_target=gpu_compute_target,
                 script_params = {...},
                 entry_script='run_squad.azureml.py',
                 conda_packages=['tensorflow', 'boto3', 'tqdm'],
                 node_count=node_count,
                 process_count_per_node=process_count_per_node,
                 distributed_backend='mpi',
                 use_gpu=True)

```
Azure Machine Learning is greatly simplifying the work involved in setting up and running a distributed training job. As you can see, scaling the job to multiple workers is done by just changing the number of nodes in the configuration and providing a distributed backend. For distributed backends, Azure Machine Learning supports popular frameworks such as TensorFlow Parameter server as well as MPI with Horovod, and it ties in with the Azure hardware such as InfiniBand to connect the different worker nodes to achieve optimal performance. We will have a follow up blogpost on how to use the distributed training capability on Azure Machine Learning service to fine-tune NLP models.

### **Hyper Parameter Tuning**

For a given customer&#39;s specific use case, model performance depends heavily on the hyperparameter values selected. Hyperparameters can have a big search space, and exploring each option can be very expensive. Azure Machine Learning Services provide an automated machine learning service, which provides hyperparameter tuning capabilities and can search across various hyperparameter configurations to find a configuration that results in the best performance.

In the provided example, random sampling is used, in which case hyperparameter values are randomly selected from the defined search space. In the example below, we explored the learning rate space from 1e-4 to 1e-6 in log uniform manner, so the learning rate might be 2 values around 1e-4, 2 values around 1e-5, and 2 values around 1e-6.

Customers can also select which metric to optimize. Validation loss, accuracy score, and F1 score are some popular metrics that could be selected for optimization.

For each experiment, customers can watch the progress for different hyperparameter combinations. For example, the picture below shows the mean loss over time using different hyperparameter combinations. Some of the experiments can be terminated early if the training loss doesn&#39;t meet expectations (like the top red curve).

![Mean loss for training data for different runs, as well as early termination](https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/bdbe13c8-0011-49de-a019-4731cd3951cb.png)

For more information on how to use the Azure ML&#39;s automated hyperparameter tuning feature, please visit our documentation on [tuning hyperparameters](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/how-to-tune-hyperparameters). And for how to track all the experiments, please visit the documentation on [how to track experiments and metrics](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/how-to-track-experiments).

## **Visualizing the result**

Using the Azure Machine Learning service, customers can achieve 85 percent evaluation accuracy when fine-tuning MRPC in GLUE dataset (it requires 3 epochs for BERT base model), which is close to the state-of-the-art result. Using multiple GPUs can shorten the training time and using more powerful GPUs (say V100) can also improve the training time. For one of the specific experiments, the details are as below:

| **GPU#** | **1** | **2** | **4** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **K80 (NC Family)** | 191 s/epoch | 105 s/epoch | 60 s/epoch |
| **V100 (NCv3 Family)** | 36 s/epoch | 22 s/epoch | 13 s/epoch |

_Table 1. Training time per epoch for MRPC in GLUE dataset_

After all the experiments are done, the Azure Machine Learning service SDK also provides a summary visualization on the selected metrics and the corresponding hyperparameter(s). Below is an example on how learning rate affects validation loss. Throughout the experiments, the learning rate has been changed from around 7e-6 (the far left) to around 1e-3 (the far right), and the best learning rate with lowest validation loss is around 3.1e-4. This chart can also be leveraged to evaluate other metrics that customers want to optimize.
